# Daily Open Source

This is a collection of projects and blog posts for [Daily OpenSource](http://dailyopensource.tumblr.com/)

## Why?

Every day i browse tons of articles and open source projects. Some of them are
useful, some are just interesting. I pick a few worth checking out and publish
them (almost) daily. 

I tried a few ways to organize this kind of stuff, no luck, things just get lost.
Plus i wanted to have a generic way to store daily records.
